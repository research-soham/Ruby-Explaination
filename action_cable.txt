Action Cable is a feature of the Ruby on Rails web application framework that enables real-time communication between the client-side and server-side components of a web application. It allows for bidirectional communication between the client (typically a web browser) and the server over a single, persistent WebSocket connection.

Action Cable is built on top of the WebSocket protocol, which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This enables real-time updates, such as chat applications, notifications, live feeds, and collaborative editing, without the need for constant polling or refreshing of the web page.

In Rails, Action Cable provides an easy-to-use API for implementing WebSocket-based features. It integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Rails stack, including ActiveRecord for database interaction and Action View for rendering views.

Key components of Action Cable include:

Channels: Channels are like controllers for WebSocket connections. They handle the incoming WebSocket requests and broadcast messages to subscribers.

Subscriptions: Subscriptions represent a connection between the client and a specific channel. Clients subscribe to channels to receive updates and notifications.

Streams: Streams allow messages to be broadcast to specific subsets of subscribers within a channel. This helps to organize and manage message distribution efficiently.

Redis or ActiveSupport::Cache: Action Cable can use either Redis or ActiveSupport::Cache to manage the WebSocket connections and handle message broadcasting efficiently in a multi-server deployment scenario.

Overall, Action Cable simplifies the development of real-time web applications in Rails by providing a convenient abstraction for handling WebSocket connections and managing real-time communication between clients and servers.
