Imagine you have a big library with lots of books organized into different sections like fiction, non-fiction, and so on. Each section has shelves full of books.

Now, think of Zeitwerk as a librarian who knows exactly where each book belongs based on its title and genre. When someone asks for a specific book, the librarian can quickly find it on the right shelf without needing extra instructions.

Similarly, Zeitwerk is like a smart librarian for your Ruby on Rails project. It automatically organizes and loads your code files (like books) into the correct places (like shelves) based on their names and locations in your project. So, when your Rails app needs to use a class or module, Zeitwerk knows just where to find it, saving you time and effort in managing your code.
